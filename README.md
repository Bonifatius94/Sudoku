# ABOUT
This is a project that deals with algorithmic issues when trying to solve / generate sudoku puzzles. Those algorithmic features are then used by a small C# WPF Desktop App for demonstration purposes.

# HOW TO BUILD THE PROJECT
Just install Visual Studio CE 2015 or higher, open the *.sln file and build the project by hitting 'Debug' / 'Build' buttons as usual. All dependencies are managed by NuGet.

# ROADMAP
- make generator work
